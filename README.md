**Why i choose this:**

I choose this project because most calorie calculator apps are paid and lack essential features. This app will provide a free, user-friendly solution with quick meal logging, customizable food lists, meal reminders, engaging gamification, and detailed nutrient tracking, helping fitness enthusiasts seamlessly manage their dietary goals.
